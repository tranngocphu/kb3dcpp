KB3D++ is an implementation of KB3D in C++. KB3D is a set of algorithms 
for conflict detection and resolution in a three dimensional geometry. 
The algorithms have been formally verified in the Prototype Verification
System (PVS). 

DISCLAIMER
----------
PVS assumes perfect real number arithmetic. This C++ prototype uses instead
floating point arithmetic. Discrepancies between PVS theoretical results
and C++ implementation results should be expected.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
1. Gunzip and untar the file KB3D++-2.b.tgz. Alternatively, you may 
   unzip KB3D++-2.b.zip.

2. In a directory  KB3D++-2.b, you will find the following files:

README		This file
Makefile    Make file
util	  	Utility and unit conversion functions
Geodesic 	Functions for transforming geodesic to rectangular coordinates
CD3D	  	Conflict detection algorithm  
KB3D	  	Conflict resolution algorithm 
LoS         Loss of separation recovery algorithm 
CDR		    User-friendly interface to CD3D/KB3D 
main		Example of usage of CDR

3. Compile everything:
$ make kb3d 

4. Run a simple example:
$ ./kb3d
